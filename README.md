## About Me

👋 Hi, I’m Stephen Fletcher.

After a career in x-ray hardware development - where I was troubleshooter-in-chief for a large high tech engineering firm - I chose to switch domain to software development. Over the years I've built some very transferable knowledge and skills: in product design and development, customer service, fault-finding and diagnosis, team-working, coaching, management and leadership.

Please see my CV [here](https://github.com/stephenfletchtek/CV).

## Makers Bootcamp

🌱 Since moving away from hardware I have completed a 12 week bootcamp at [Makers](https://github.com/makersacademy) to improve my skills in a team based environment covering many key areas of software development.

## Before Makers

:gear: I worked assiduously to fill knowledge and skill gaps. For back-end development I built a web app using Python 3, and Django. I also practiced working with APIs and OAUTH 2.0 for one of my personal home automation projects; and have grown my understanding of common web security risks (e.g. OWASP Top 10).

## Next

👀 I plan to leverage in the world of software the superpowers I developed for hardware: test design, debugging and remediation in complex and tightly coupled systems. Right now though, my priority is increasing my exposure to new, diverse challenges so I can be delivering value whilst growing professionally.
